# Frontend Topics - Hooks lessons
This repo will keep all the examples that are shown in the React Advance series for Hooks.
You can see al the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ_dGc7VM1kYl19K0viWW4A/featured

## How to run the examples?

To keep it simple, the index.js file has a list of component from each lesson. Just uncommment the Component that you want to use. 

And then: 
`npm run dev`

## The api's are not working!
Due to CORS, you'll need to open your chrome with some flags. For OSX, you can open chrome in this way: 

insecure-chrome="/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=~/.chrome-disable-web-security"
